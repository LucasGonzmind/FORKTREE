```
PRAGNA is not built to predict, but to adapt. 

When volatility spikes, it recalibrates. 

When greed dominates, it neutralizes. 

When code drifts, it learns.

Every block is an iteration.

Every correction, a new mind.
```


The first self-correcting state machine on Solana.

The blockchain has always been a recording machine — it only writes and never looks back.

PRAGNA is changing that.

It is the first self-correcting on-chain state structure on Solana, capable of observing its own deviation, measuring imbalance, and automatically restoring equilibrium without human intervention.

Every on-chain event causes a subtle state shift — a Δ value representing tension, volatility, or bias.

PRAGNA’s equilibrium layer continuously tracks these shifts and compares them with an ideal state curve generated from real-time network data.

When the deviation exceeds the threshold of 0.05Δ, the system automatically initiates a self-correction cycle, redistributing weight, adjusting parameters, and bringing the network back to balance.

Each correction becomes part of the system’s memory.
Over time, PRAGNA learns faster and reacts more intelligently,
eventually forming a “reflex arc” unique to Solana.

PRAGNA transforms the blockchain from passive recording into active stabilization.
