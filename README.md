# MONBRG — Solana → Monad Liquidity Bridge Router

MONBRG is an intelligent cross-chain router that bridges Solana assets to the Monad ecosystem through the most optimal route and deploys them directly into yield-generating opportunities — all in a single confirmation.

Bridging is no longer relocation — it is yield capture.

---

## 🚀 What MONBRG Does
MONBRG automates the entire lifecycle of Solana → Monad capital migration:

- Scans user assets and positions on Solana
- Evaluates real-time bridge metrics (fees, speed, slippage, execution probability)
- Executes the most optimal Sol → Monad bridging route
- Deploys assets instantly into yield opportunities on Monad (LP pools, staking, incentives, point systems, airdrop-eligible programs)

Users no longer need to research bridges, compare strategies, or monitor trends.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow — 3 Steps

**1. Scan & Analyze**  
Connect your Solana wallet. MONBRG evaluates asset composition and yield opportunities across Monad using real-time bridge simulations.

**2. Route & Bridge**  
The system selects the most optimal Sol → Monad route and executes the transfer with a single confirmation.

**3. Deploy & Earn**  
Once assets arrive on Monad, they are automatically deployed into yield-generating scenarios. Users can track performance and switch strategies anytime.

## 🔑 Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Optimal Bridge Routing | Real-time simulation of bridge fees, speed, success rate, and slippage |
| Automated Yield Deployment | Funds are deployed directly into earning opportunities upon arrival |
| Unified Dashboard | Portfolio and performance tracking across chains |
| Non-custodial | All actions are executed through the user’s wallet — fully verifiable on-chain |
| Designed for both pros & newcomers | Zero configuration required — one click to earn |

---

## 🧱 Vision
MONBRG transforms cross-chain bridging from a technical hurdle into a yield-optimized capital movement layer.  
Assets continuously seek higher return density instead of remaining idle on a single network.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- Phase 1 — Core routing engine (Sol → Monad)
- Phase 2 — Yield deployment modules and strategy presets
- Phase 3 — Strategy switching & risk-profiling system
- Phase 4 — Developer Bridge SDK for ecosystem integrations
- Phase 5 — Multi-chain expansions based on demand

---

## 🛡️ Security
- Non-custodial routing and deployment
- All transactions signed by the user’s wallet
- No private key storage or proxy custody
